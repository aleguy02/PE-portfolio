Possible tests:
- e2e tests using different browsers (playwright)
- e2e tests using different view sizes (also playwright)
- unit tests with pytest... there's no functionality right now so hold off on these until more functionality is implemented
- test bad requests
- test routing
- spamming with requests
exercise: write a script to overload with requests, then use either the droplet UI or other network monitoring tools to verify that the server is indeed being overloaded
